# expressjs.com

This is the repository of the website [www.expressjs.com](http://www.expressjs.com). It is hosted directly from the repository as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

## Local Setup

GitHub Pages websites being served through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you will need to replicate the setup on your local machine to preview the website locally.

[Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your system, if you don't have them already.

Once installed, `cd` to the respository directory and run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ jekyll s
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) on your browser.

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), read up the docs if you need to go beyond basic Markdown in the doc files.

To understand the template system used by Jekyll, read up the [Liquid template engine docs](http://liquidmarkup.org/).

## Contributing
